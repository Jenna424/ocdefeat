<h3>Deconstructing the Obsession</h3>

<br>

<div class="well well-lg">
  <ul>
    <li>
      The intrusive thought "<%= @obsession.intrusive_thought %>" was manufactured by my OCD
      and is not a true reflection of me.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
      Although my anxiety reaches its peak at level <%= @obsession.anxiety_rating %>, I know that
      it will de-escalate, and symptoms such as <%= @obsession.symptoms %> will eventually disappear.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
      I will control my response to triggers such as <%= @obsession.triggers %>,
      rather than avoiding them or engaging in rituals such as <%= @obsession.rituals %>.
    </li>
  </ul>
